${symbol_pound} Acquiring the project

The project files are hosted on a [Bintray repository][bintray-repo], and have been replicated on JCenter and OSS Sonatype, which also replicates into the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo]. While this means that it should be possible to download the Archetype from any of those repositories, the recommended one is Bintray.

Unlike other types of project a Maven archetype does not require dependency control. Instead the dependency data is required during it's [usage][usage].

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Archetype data

The following data is always required to identify the Archetype, no matter through which method it is used:

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Version identification

|Group ID|Artifact ID|Version|
|---|---|---|---|
|$project.groupId|$project.artifactId|$project.version|

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Downloads link

|Repository URL|
|---|
|$repoDownloadURL |

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Installing the Archetype

Usually the Archetype is downloaded when first used, but as an alternative it is also possible to get the code from the [code repository][code-repo] and then install it by using the following command which, due to the POM file configuration, will also update the local repository:

```sh
$ mvn install
```

[code-repo]: $project.scm.url
[bintray-repo]: ${bintrayURL}
[maven-repo]: ${mavenURL}

[usage]: ./usage.html
