# Information files

Two files are included on the archetype which will give additional information about the new project. One is the license file, and the other is the readme.

## License

The included file is for the MIT license. If you change it, remember to modify the POM and readme files accordingly.

## Readme

The readme gives information about the project. It has to be tuned for the new project, mostly the description has to be changed to fit it.

The links on the readme are generated from the archetype properties, and can be modified when creating a new project with it.
