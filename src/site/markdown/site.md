# Site

The Archetype is prepared to create a Maven site, similar to this one, which will keep the documentation along several reports.

This site is created with the help of the [Docs Maven Skin][docs-skin], but for the most part is just a normal [Maven site][maven-site].

## Creating the site

There is a small problem with the site generation, and it is that by default Maven won't run the verification phase before generating the site, meaning that it won't show the results of the integration tests.

To correct this, the site should be generated by using the following command:

```sh
$ mvn verify site
```

## Reports

To avoid dependencies to external service Maven takes care of all the analysis and tests, the results of which are shown on the Maven site. These reports handle common things such as code quality or test coverage, and a few additional features like the changes list.

By default, the following reports are added to the site:

- [Changes](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/)
- [Tag list](http://www.mojohaus.org)
- [Checkstyle](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/)
- [FindBugs](http://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/)
- [PMD](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/)
- [Surefire](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)
- [Failsafe](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/)
- [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html)
- [JDepend](mojo.codehaus.org/jdepend-maven-plugin)

### Customized reports

The archetype contains modified configuration files for PMD and Checkstyle, meant to reduce the noise of both those reports.

### Changes report

The changes log file is stored on the 'src/changes' folder. It is the 'changes.xml' file, and should be updated to reflect changes made to the project on each version.

More information about this file can be found at the [changes.xml specification][changes-spec].
