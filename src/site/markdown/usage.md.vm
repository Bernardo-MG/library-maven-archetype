${symbol_pound} Setting up the dependencies

The project files are hosted on [Bintray repo][bintray-repo], and have been replicated on JCenter and OSS Sonatype, which also replicates into the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo]. This means that it should be possible to download the archetype from any of those repositories.

To download the project from the repository use the following data:

```
Group ID: com.wandrell.archetype
Artifact ID: library
Version: ${projectVersion}
URL: https://dl.bintray.com/bernardo-mg/maven/
```

For example, to download it and generate a new project through Maven use the following command:

```
$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.wandrell.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=library -DarchetypeVersion=${projectVersion} -DarchetypeRepository=https://dl.bintray.com/bernardo-mg/maven/
```

Of course, it may also be added to the local repository through your preferred IDE, just by using that same information.

As an alternative, it is also possible to download the project from Github, and then install the project into the local archetypes repository using the following command:

```
mvn install
```
